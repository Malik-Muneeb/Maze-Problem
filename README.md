# Maze-Problem

a	 simple	maze with	 hurdles	 and	find	the	route	from	the	starting	point	to	the	exit	point.

Given program	that	can	read	a	file	containing	the	following	
contents:
1) 1st row	of	the	file	represents	Number	 of	Rows	 and	Number	 of Columns	(2D	Array)	 separated	
with	space.
2) 2nd row	of	the	file	represents	Number	of	Hurdles	in	that	particular	maze.
3) Rest	 of	 the	 rows	 in	 the	 file	 provides	 Indices	 on	 which	 you	 have	 to	 mark	 hurdles.	 Each	 line	
provides	you	rows	and	columns	separated	with	space.

program print	the	maze	on	the	console
Once	the	maze	is	created, it print	the	route	from	starting	point	to	the	exit	point. The	route	
should compute	a	path	that	leads	you	from	the	starting	point	(row	0,	column	0)	to	the	exit E without	
observing	any	hurdle.
